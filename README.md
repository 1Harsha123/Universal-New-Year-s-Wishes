# Universal-New-Year-s-Wishes

The provided Python program utilizes the pyttsx3 library and the win32com.client module to implement a simple text-to-speech functionality. The primary objective is to read lines from a file named "happy.txt" and both print them to the console and speak them using a text-to-speech engine. The speak_and_print function is introduced to encapsulate this dual action. It takes a string, removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip() method, prints the cleaned line to the console, and then uses the speak function to vocalize the line. The speak function, in turn, relies on the SAPI.SPVOICE Dispatch object from the win32com.client module to perform the text-to-speech conversion. This way, the program combines file input/output operations, string manipulation, and text-to-speech capabilities to present the content of the "happy.txt" file in both visual and auditory formats.
